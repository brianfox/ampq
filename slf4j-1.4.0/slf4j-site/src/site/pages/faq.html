      <dd>
        <p>SLF4J is a simple facade for logging systems allowing the
        end-user to plug-in the desired logging system at deployment
        time.
       </p>
      

       <table border="0">
       <tr><td align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></td></tr>
       </table>
       <hr />
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="when">
      When should SLF4J be used?
      </a></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>In short, libraries and other embedded components should
        consider SLF4J for their logging needs because libraries
        cannot afford to impose their choice of logging system on the
        end-user. On the other hand, it does not necessarily make
        sense for stand-alone applications to use SLF4J. Stand-alone
        applications can invoke the logging system of their choice
        directly.
       </p>

        <p>SLF4J is only a facade, meaning that it does not provide a
        complete logging solution. Operations such as configuring
        appenders or setting logging levels cannot be performed with
        SLF4J. Thus, at same point in time, any non-trivial
        application will need to directly invoke the underlying
        logging system. In other words, complete independence from the
        API underlying logging system is not possible for a
        stand-alone application. Nevertheless, SLF4J reduces the
        impact of this dependence to near-painless levels.
       </p>

        <p>Suppose that your CRM application uses log4j for its
        logging. However, one of your important clients request that
        logging be performed through JDK 1.4 logging. If your
        application is riddled with thousands of direct log4j calls,
        migration to JDK 1.4 would be a long and error-prone
        process. Had you been invoking SLF4J API instead of log4j, the
        migration could be completed in a matter of minutes instead of
        hours.
       </p>

        <p>SLF4J lets component developers to defer the choice of the
        logging system to the end-user but eventually a choice needs
        to be made.

        <a name="yet_another_facade">
        Is SLF4J yet another logging facade?  </a></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>SLF4J is conceptually similar to JCL. As such, it can be
          thought of as yet another logging facade. However, SLF4J is
          orders of magnitude simpler in design and arguably more
          robust.
       </p>

       <table border="0"><tr><td align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></td></tr></table><hr />

       </dd>
       <dt>
         <a name="why_new_project">
           If SLF4J fixes JCL, then why wasn't the fix made in JCL
           instead of creating a new project?
           </a>
       </dt>

       <dd>
         <p>This is a very good question. First, SLF4J static binding
         approach is very simple, perhaps even laughably so. It was
         not easy to convince developers of the validity of the
         approach. It is only after SLF4J was released and started to
         become accepted did the approach gain respectability in the
         relevant community.
       </p>

        <p>Second, SLF4J offers two enhancements which developers
        currently tend to underestimate. Parameterized log messages
        solve an important problem associated with logging performance
        in a pragmatic way. Marker objects, which are supported by the
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface, pave the way for
        adoption of advanced logging systems and still leave the door
        open to switching back to more traditional logging systems if
        need be.

       When using SLF4J, do I have to recompile my application

       </a></dt>

       <dd>
       No, you do not need to recompile your application. You can
       switch to a different logging system by removing the previous
       SLF4J binding and replacing it with the binding of your choice.

        <p>For example, if you were using the NOP implementation and
        would like to switch to log4j version 1.2, simply replace
        <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em> with <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> on your
        class path but do not forget to add log4j-1.2.x.jar as
        well. Want to switch to JDK 1.4 logging?  Just replace
        <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> with <em>slf4j-jdk14.jar</em>.

         <a name="requirements">What are SLF4J's requirements?</a>
       </dt>

       <dd>

         <p>In principle, SLF4J requires JDK 1.3 or above, in
         particular slf4j-api is compatible with JDK 1.3.  However,
         the underlying logging system might have a higher
         requirement. For instance, the <em>slf4j-jdk14</em> binding
         requires JDK 1.4. Logback requires JDK 1.5, unless you are
         using the 1.4 retro-translated jars.

        <p>Embedded components such as libraries do not need and
        should not configure the logging system. They invoke SLF4J to
        log but should let the end-user configure the logging
        environment. When embedded components try to configure logging
        on their own, they often override the end-user's wishes. At
        the end of the day, it is the end-user who has to read the
        logs and process them. She should be the person to decide how
        she wants her logging configured.

       <dd>
         <p>As an author of a library built with Maven2, you might
         want to test your application using a binding, say
         slf4j-log4j12 or logback-classic, without forcing log4j or
         logback-classic as a dependency upon your users. As of SLF4J
         version 1.3, this quite easy to accomplish. But first, since
         your library's code depends on the SLF4J API you will need to
         declare slf4j-api as a compile-time (default scope)
         dependency.
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>         
       <p class="source">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>         

       <p>Limiting the transitivity of the SLF4J binding used in your
       tests can be accomplished by declaring the scope of the
       SLF4J-binding dependency as "test".  Here is an example:</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>         

       <p class="source">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-log4j12&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
  <b>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</b>
&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>

        <p>Thus, as far as your users are concerned you are exporting
        slf4j-api as a transitive dependency of your library, but not
        any SLF4J-binding or an underlying logging system.

       <h2>About the SLF4J API</h2>

       <dl>

       <dt><a name="string_or_object"> Why don't the printing methods
       in the Logger interface accept message of type Object, but only
       messages of type String?  </a>
       </dt>

       <dd>

        <p>In SLF4J 1.0beta4, the printing methods such as debug(),
        info(), warn(), error() in the <a
        href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">Logger interface</a> were
        modified so as to accept only messages of type String instead
        of Object.
       </p>

        <p>Thus, the set of printing methods for the DEBUG level
        became:</p>

        <p class="source">debug(String msg); 
debug(String format, Object arg); 
debug(String format, Object arg1, Object arg2);           
debug(String msg, Throwable t);</p>

        <p>Previously, the first argument in the above methods was of
        type <code>Object</code>.</p>

        <p>This change enforces the notion that logging systems are
        about decorating and handling messages of type String, and not
        any arbitrary type (Object).
       </p>

        <p>Just as importantly, the new set of method signatures offer
        a clearer differentiation between the overladed methods
        whereas previously the choice of the invoked method due to
        Java overloding rules were not always easy to follow.</p>

        <p>It was also easy to make mistakes. For example, previously
        it was legal to write:</p>

        <p class="source">logger.debug(new Exception("some error"));</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the above call did not print the stack trace
        of the exception. Thus, a potentially crucial piece of
        information could be lost. When the first parameter is
        restricted to be of type String, then only the method
       </p>
       <p class="source">debug(String msg, Throwable t)</p>
       
       <p>can be used to log exceptions. Note that this method
       ensures that every logged exception is accompanied with a
       descriptive message.</p>
       
        <table border="0"><tr><td align="right"><a href="#top">[top]</a></td></tr></table><hr />
        </dd>

        <dt>

          <a name="exception_message">
            Can I log an exception without an accompanying message?
          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In short, no.</p>
          
          <p>If <code>e</code> is an <code>Exception</code>, and you
          would like to log an exception at the ERROR level, you must
          add an accompanying message. For example,</p>

          <p class="source">logger.error("some accompanying message", e);</p>
        
        <p>You might correctly observe that not all exceptions have a
        meaningful message to accompany them. Moreover, a good
        exception should already contain a self explanatory
        description. The accompanying message may therefore be
        considered redundant.
       </p>


        <p>While these are valid arguments, there are three opposing
        arguments also worth considering. First, on many, albeit not
        all occasions, the accompanying message can convey useful
        information nicely complementing the description contained in
        the exception. Frequently, at the point where the exception is
        logged, the developer has access to more contextual
        information than at the point where the exception is
        thrown. Second, it is not difficult to imagine more or less
        generic messages, e.g. "Exception caught", "Exception
        follows", that can be used as the first argument for
        <code>error(String msg, Throwable t)</code> invocations.
        Third, most log output formats display the message on a line,
        followed by the exception on a separate line. Thus, the
        message line would look inconsistent without a message.
       </p>

        <p>In short, if the user were allowed to log an exception
        without an accompanying message, it would be the job of the
        logging system to invent a message. This is actually what the
        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cr9kg">throwing(String
        sourceClass, String sourceMethod, Throwable thrown)</a> method
        in java.util.logging package does. (It decides on its own that
        accompanying message is the string "THROW".)
       </p>
        
        <p>It may initially appear strange to require an accompanying
        message to log an exception. Nevertheless, this is common
        practice in <em>all</em> log4j derived systems such as
        java.util.logging, logkit, etc. and of course log4j itself. It
        seems that the current consensus considers requiring an
        accompanying message as a good a thing (TM).

        (not) logging?</a></dt><dd>

        <p> For some Logger <code>logger</code>, writing,</p>
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));</p>
        
        <p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that
        is converting both integer <code>i</code> and
        <code>entry[i]</code> to a String, and concatenating
        intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether the message
        will be logged or not.
        </p>        

        <p>One possible way to avoid the cost of parameter
        construction is by surrounding the log statement with a
        test. Here is an example.</p>

        <p class="source">if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
}</p>


       <p>This way you will not incur the cost of parameter
       construction if debugging is disabled for
       <code>logger</code>. On the other hand, if the logger is
       enabled for the DEBUG level, you will incur the cost of
       evaluating whether the logger is enabled or not, twice: once in
       <code>debugEnabled</code> and once in <code>debug</code>.  This
       is an insignificant overhead because evaluating a logger takes
       less than 1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.
       </p>

	

        <p><b>Better alternative based on format messages</b></p>
        
        <p>There exists a very convenient alternative based on message
        formats. Assuming <code>entry</code> is an object, you can write:
       </p>
        
        
        <p class="source">Object entry = new SomeObject();
logger.debug("The entry is {}.", entry);</p>
        
        <p>After evaluting whether to log or not, and only if the
        decision is affirmative, will the logger implementation format
        the message and replace the '{}' pair with the string value of
        <code>entry</code>. In other words, tis form does not incur
        the cost of parameter construction in case the log statement
        is disabled.
       </p>
        
        <p>The following two lines will yield the exact same
        output. However, the second form will outperform the first
        form by a factor of at least 30, in case of a
        <em>disabled</em> logging statement.
       </p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is "+entry+".");
logger.debug("The new entry is {}.", entry);</p>
   
   
        <p>A two argument variant is also availalble. For example, you can
        write:</p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is {}. It replaces {}.", entry, oldEntry);</p>

        <p>If three or more arguments need to be passed, an
        <code>Object[]</code> variant is also availalble. For example,
        you can write:</p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Value {} was inserted between {} and {}.", 
             new Object[] {newVal, below, above});</p>

      How can I log the string contents of a single (possibly

      </a></dt><dd>
        <p>
        In relatively rare cases where the message to be logged is the
        string form of an object, then the parameterized printing
        method of the appropriate level can be used. Assuming
        <code>complexObject</code> is an object of certain complexity,
        for a log statement of level DEBUG, you can write:
       </p>

        <p class="source">logger.debug("{}", complexObject);</p>


        <p>The logging system will invoke
        <code>complexObject.toString()</code> method only after it has
        ascertained that the log statement was enabled. Otherwise, the
        cost of <code>complexObject.toString()</code> conversion will
        be advantageously avoided.

      Why doesn't the <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
      have methods for the FATAL level?
      </a></dt><dd>
        <p>From the stand point of a logging system, the distinction
        between a fatal error and an error is usually not very
        useful. Most programmers exit the application when a fatal
        error is encountered. However, a logging library cannot (and
        should not) decide on its own to terminate an application. The
        initiative to exit the application must be left to the
        developer.
       </p>


        <p>Thus, the most the FATAL level can do is to
        <em>highlight</em> a given error as the cause for application
        to crash. However, errors are by definition exceptional events
        that merit attention. If a given situation causes errors to be
        logged, the causes should be attended to as soon as
        possible. However, if the "error" is actually a normal
        situation which cannot be prevented but merits being aware of,
        then it should be marked as WARN, not ERROR.
       </p>
        
        <p>Assuming the ERROR level designates exceptional situations
        meriting close attention, we are inclined to believe that the
        FATAL level is superfluous.

      <dd>

        <p>The addition of the TRACE level has been frequently and
        hotly debated request. By studying various projects, we
        observed that the TRACE level was used to disable logging
        output from certain classes <em>without</em> needing to
        configure logging for those classes. Indeed, the TRACE level
        is by default disabled in log4j and logback as well most other
        logging systems. The same result can be achieved by adding the
        appropriate directives in configuration files.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, in many of cases the TRACE level carried the same
        semantic meaning as DEBUG. In such cases, the TRACE level
        merely saves a few configuration directives. In other, more
        interesting occasions, where TRACE carries a different meaning
        than DEBUG, <a href="api/org/slf4j/Marker.html">Marker</a>
        objects can be put to use to convey the desired
        meaning. However, if you can't be bothered with markers and
        wish to use a logging level lower than DEBUG, the TRACE level
        can get the job done.
        </p>

        <p>Note that while the cost of evaluating a disabled log
        request is in the order of a few <code>nanoseconds</code>, the
        use of the TRACE level (or any other level for that matter) is
        discouraged in tight loops where the log request might be
        evaluated millions of times. If the log request is enabled,
        then it will overwhelm the target destination with massive
        output. If the request is disabled, it will waste resources.
        </p>
      
        <p>In short, although we still discourage the use of the TRACE
        level because alternatives exist or because in many cases log
        requests of level TRACE are wasteful, given that people kept
        asking for it, we decided to bow to popular demand.

        How do I make my logging framework SLF4J
        compatible?
        </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
        
        <p>Adding supporting for the SLF4J is suprisingly
        easy. Essentialy, you coping an existing binding and tailoring
        it a little (as explained below) does the trick.
       </p>

        <p>If you are a Maven2 user, you can use the
        slf4j-archetype. Invoke the following command to create a new
        module called <em>slf4j-MY</em> with much of the plumbing
        alredy in place.</p>
        
        <p class="source">mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.slf4j -DartifactId=slf4j-MY \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.slf4j -DarchetypeArtifactId=slf4j-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=${project.version}</p>

        <p>At this stage, assuming your logging system has notion of a
        logger, called say <code>MyLogger</code>, you need to provide
        an adapter for <code>MyLogger</code> to
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface. Refer to slf4j-jcl,
        slf4j-jdk14, and slf4j-log4j12 modules for examples of
        adapters.
       </p>

        <p>Once you have written an appropriate adapter, say
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>, you need to provide a factory
        class implementing the <code>org.slf4j.ILoggerFactory</code>
        interface. This factory should return instances
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>. Let <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>
        be the name of your factory class.
       </p>

        <p>Once you have the adapter, namely
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>, and a factory, namely
        <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>, the last remaining step is to
        modify the <code>StaticLoggerBinder</code> class so that it
        reurns an new instance of <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>. You
        will also need to modify the
        <code>loggerFactoryClassStr</code> variable.
       </p>
        
        <p>That's it. You don't need to modify any other files.</p>

        <p>In summary, to create an SLF4J binding for your logging
        system, follow these steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>start with a copy of an existing module, or create a new
          binding using slf4j-archetype as discussed above</li>
          <li>create an adapter between your logging system and
          <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
         </li>
          <li>create a factory for the adapter created in the previous step,</li>
          <li>>modify <code>StaticLoggerBinder</code> class to use the
          factory you created in the previous step</li>
       </ol>

      How can my logging system add support for
      the <code>Marker</code> interface?
      </a></dt><dd>
        <p>Markers consitute a revolutionary concept which is
        supported by LOGBack but not other existing logging
        systems. Consequently, SLF4J confromant logging systems are
        allowed to ignore marker data passed by the user.
       </p>

        <p>However, even though marker data may be ignored, the user
        must still be allowed to specify marker data. Otherwise, users
        would not be able to switch between logging systems that
        support markers and those that do not.  In order to provide
        minimal support for markers, SLF4J conformant systems need to
        to include certain Marker related classes, namely,
        <code>org.slf4j.Marker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.IMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.MarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.StaticMarkerBinder</code> and
        <code>org.slf4j.spi.MarkerFactoryBinder</code>. Al of these
        classes are availalbe in the SLF4J subversion repository.
       </p>

        <p>The <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> class can serve as a
        base for adapters or native implementations of logging systems
        lacking marker support. In <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        methods taking marker data simply invoke the corresponding
        method without the Marker argument, discarding any Marker data
        passed as argument. Your SLF4J adapters can extend
        <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> to quickly implement the
        methods in <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> which take a
        <code>Marker</code> as the first argument.

      Should Logger members of a class be declared as static?
      </a></dt><dd>

        <p>This author recommends that loggers members be declared
        as instance variables instead of static. 
       </p>

        <p>Static logger members cost a single variable reference for
        all instances of the class whereas an instance logger member
        will cost a variable reference for every instance of the
        class. For simple classes instantiated thousands of times
        there might be a noticeable difference.
       </p>

        <p>However, more recent logging systems, e.g log4j or logback,
        support a distinct logger context for each application running
        in the application server. Thus, even if a single copy of
        <em>log4j.jar</em> or <em>logback-classic.jar</em> is deployed
        in the server, the logging system will be able to
        differentiate between applications and offer a distinct
        logging environment for each application.
       </p>

        <p>More specifically, each time a logger is retrieved by
        invoking <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger()</code> method, the
        underlying logging system will return an instance appropriate
        for the current application. Please note that within the
        <em>same</em> application retrieving a logger by a given name
        will always return the same logger. For a given name, a
        different logger will be returned only for different
        applications.
       </p>

        <p>If the logger is static, then it will only be retrieved
        once when the hosting class is loaded into memory. If the
        hosting class is used in only in one application, there is not
        much to be concerned about. However, if the hosting class is
        shared between several applications, then all instances of the
        shared class will log into the context of the application
        which happened to fist load the shared class into memory -
        hardly the behavior expected by the user.
       </p>

        <p>In summary, except for classes with few members
        <em>and</em> instantiated very frequently, logger members
        should be instance variables.
